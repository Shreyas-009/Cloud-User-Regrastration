## Project Overview
This project demonstrates cloud-based user data storage using MongoDB Atlas with a Node.js/Express.js backend and a React frontend. It showcases the integration of a React frontend with a cloud database to provide user registration and dashboard functionality.

## What I Learned
* Implementing **cloud database storage** in a Node.js application
* Integrating **MongoDB Atlas** for persistent data storage
* Creating scalable backend endpoints for user registration
* Managing user data in a cloud database
* Building responsive React frontend for data collection
* Implementing error handling in registration process
* Handling data transmission between frontend and backend
* Creating dynamic user dashboards

This project demonstrates the practical application of cloud database integration and full-stack web development practices in a real-world user registration scenario.
